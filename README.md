A quiet place on the web where I write — sometimes about code, sometimes about systems and teams, and sometimes just to think out loud.

This is my personal blog, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), designed to be minimal and calm, without distractions.

## ✨ Purpose

This space is not for hot takes or tutorials. It’s for slowing down. For writing without pressure. For sharing thoughts that might resonate with someone who’s walking a similar path — whether as an engineer, a lead, or just a curious mind.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style) for styling
- Markdown & MDX for posts
