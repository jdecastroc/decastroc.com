	<p>Hola, I’m Jorge!</p>

  <p>
     I come from a quiet town near Madrid, the kind of place where people know each other and life moves at its own rhythm.
    Since I was a kid I've been interested in computers, web development, how things work... Passionate about video games,
    I was always amazed by what happened behind the scenes. I found myself more interested in creating <strong>Warcraft III</strong>
    or <strong>Counter-Strike</strong> maps than just playing them—curious about how engines worked, how others could interact with what I made,
    and learning to program from an early age.
  </p>

  <p>
I studied <strong>Network Systems Administration</strong> in Barcelona and later earned a <strong>Computer Engineering degree</strong> in Madrid. During the pandemic, while working at Rakuten, I completed a <strong>Master's in Information Technology Management (IT MBA)</strong>. But the truth is, I was already building and experimenting long before any of that. I’ve always been drawn to systems—how they work, how they scale, and how they can be improved, whether those systems are technical, human, or a mix of both.  </p>

  <p>
    In 2016, I moved to <strong>Japan</strong>, a decision that changed both my life and my way of thinking. I was—and still am—deeply inspired by <em>omotenashi</em>, the Japanese spirit of thoughtful hospitality. There’s a quiet intentionality to how things are done here: attention to detail, care for others, and pride in small improvements. It resonates with how I approach software, teams, and design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, my work has evolved from infrastructure and full-stack development to <strong>platform engineering, design systems</strong>, and <strong>engineering leadership</strong>. I’ve worn many hats—System Administrator, Full Stack Engineer, Lead Frontend Engineer, Architect, and now <strong>Engineering Manager at Woven by Toyota</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>But titles aside, what I really care about is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design systems</strong> that bring consistency</li>
    <li><strong>Internal platforms</strong> that reduce friction and empower developers</li>
    <li><strong>Team growth</strong>, mentorship, and building environments where people can thrive</li>
    <li>Creating clarity and structure in the middle of complexity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Before joining <strong>Woven by Toyota</strong>, I spent several years at <strong>Rakuten</strong>, leading the Frontend Foundations group. I helped build internal monorepos, evolve cloud tooling, and shape Rakuten’s Design System efforts. I also led the <strong>Frontend Trainings Team</strong>, where we trained hundreds of engineers and created new content around frontend technologies and accessibility. Teaching and mentoring became one of the most fulfilling parts of my role.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier in my journey, I worked at <strong>PlayBrain</strong>, crafting esports platforms for companies like Riot, Blizzard, and Bandai Namco. I also helped build microservices and cloud APIs at <strong>PORTERS</strong>, and even earlier, I was deep in monitoring, virtualization, and infrastructure automation at <strong>Aechelon Technology</strong> back in Spain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, at <strong>Woven by Toyota</strong>, I lead a group that supports developers building the next generation of Toyota’s software-defined vehicles. Our work spans frontend, backend, and DevOps—but it’s all grounded in one idea: making complex things simpler, clearer, and more empowering for others.
  </p>

  <p>
    I care about quality, but I don’t chase perfection. I believe in structure, but not at the cost of agility. I think the best engineering happens when people feel safe, trusted, and aligned—and that’s what I try to build every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for reading. If you’re into <strong>platform thinking</strong>, <strong>engineering leadership</strong>, or just want to talk about tech, culture, or good documentation—feel free to reach out.

  <p><strong>Let’s build things that empower others—and give back to the society we live in</strong></p>
