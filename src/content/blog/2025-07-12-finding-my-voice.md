title: 'Finding My Voice'

I’ve been carrying this idea for a while... to have a space that’s mine, but not self-centered.  
Quiet, but not empty.

Over the past few years, I’ve struggled to find that space.

Most of my time has been devoted to work: shipping things, leading teams, supporting others, being “on.”  
But somewhere between the meetings, transitions, and responsibilities, I started to feel something missing —  
not dramatic, just quietly absent.  
A place to reflect. To write something down, if only to make sense of it.  
To leave notes for the future, or for someone walking a similar path.

This isn’t a place for hot takes or polished articles.  
I don’t intend to “build an audience” or prove anything.  
But I do hope the words I write here might resonate with those navigating the same messy blend of:

- **engineering leadership**,
- **software craftsmanship**, and
- **multicultural collaboration**.

Things I often wrestle with...

- like staying kind under pressure,
- like balancing technical curiosity with clarity,
- like managing self-doubt while others look to you for direction.

There won’t be a posting schedule.  
I’ll write when I have something real to say.

If you’re here — thank you.  
Let’s see where this goes :)
